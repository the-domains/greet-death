I was on the train on my way home earlier today and wondering what the fuck I could possibly say to you that would be even slightly meaningful. I couldn't think of a single godsdamned thing. No surprise really. I mean, I don't trust you, I don't believe in this process and I have no faith in this leading to any sort of viable outcome.

And as a result, I will get nothing useful out of you. And the court will get nothing useful out of either of us and this whole debacle will simply have prolonged the inevitable. I'll wind up in a home, or maybe even in actual jail and you will maybe sigh, probably shrug and then you will close the file and move onto the next case.

Maybe you'll think of me every now and then over the next few months. Most likely it'll be the next time you prescribe this ridiculous exercise to some other doomed soul. But mostly you won't think of me at all.

Me though, I'll think of you often. I'll wonder where you learned about this idea and what on earth made you think it was a useful fucking tool. I'll try to work out why you thought I'd be suited to it. I'll agonise for days and probably weeks, possibly even months, trying to understand what it was that I said or did that made you think requiring a perversity of words from me would lead to some sort of insight or breakthrough that might change the course of things.

Worst of all, I'll wonder if maybe it could have changed the course of things. I'll worry that maybe it was my fault because I didn't believe, didn't trust, didn't have faith.

That'll make me angry. I'll lash out. I always do when I'm angry. And wherever they send me, it'll be the kind of place where my lashings won't be allowed to go unpunished. Someone else will feel the need to respond, to assert themselves, to remind everyone else that they're the biggest, baddest, scariest motherfucker in the joint.

I'm going to get hurt because of you, because of this. I'm going to get hurt and I'm going to get more time. There's a very real risk that I'll become institutionalised. Or more institutionalised. I'm pretty sure your file already says that I've been in and out of too many systems for someone my age.

The strange thing for me right now though is that while I know that I will be angry at some point in the future, I'm not really all that angry now. I mean, I'm pissed off. I'm _resentful_, but I'm not actually angry. More resigned to it. You've told the monkey to dance and so this monkey knows it has to dance until the music stops. It just also knows that there's no chair waiting for it when the music stops and it'll be left with its arse hanging in the wind, waiting to be spanked.

So that's the way of it for now. And soon the way of it will be your complete lack of memory and my obsessive picking over of vaguely remembered details.

You'll go home and eat your healthy dinner while watching your guilty pleasure shows and telling your loving partner that it's so tragic, the work that you do, but you take heart in knowing that it's important.

I'll be locked in a cell smaller than your bathroom and try not to be distracted by the screams and shouts of those who are even more insane than me. I'll eat whatever shit they're legally able to get away with serving and be careful mental track of who owes me favours and who wants to hurt me. When I have a spare moment, I'll wonder if you even read all these words.

I'll ask myself if you really could be bothered to read them all and why would you even really care? I'll wonder what your reaction was to any reading you might have done. Mercifully, before that line of thought can get too self-destructive, I'll probably have to fend off a late night attempt at sexual assault from my cell-mate, so there's that to look forward to.

Tell me, do you eat a lot of kale? I bet you do. I bet your perfect fucking partner has you drinking some bullshit horrible juice every morning before you leave for work.

The hilarious thing is that you and I both know that you're not a good enough person to deserve someone looking after you so carefully. You don't deserve someone loving you enough to give you kale. You don't even deserve fresh vegetables.

I can tell, I can see it in your eyes. I see the way your eyes tighten when you read what they've accused me of, the way your mouth twitches at one corner. I can tell you're not just curious, you're something more than that.

It's not just the usual titillation either. There's something about you that amused, and... and_jealous_. That's the word. It's a sick little shadow that clings to you. The smell of a stale fart trapped in a chair you've been sitting in for too long. The lingering sense that you wish it had been yours. That you want to know what it's like to have done the things that page says I did. That you want to know how thrilled you would be after doing them. That there's part of you that thinks you might just be turned on.

You sick fuck. 

And now you know that I know. I can see it in you. And so we both know that you don't deserve love, you don't deserve trust, you sure as fuck don't deserve kale smoothies.

But that doesn't matter. It doesn't matter now and it won't matter then. I can't tell anyone, and even if I did, there's nothing to actually tell. Who's going to believe the story of a shadow? Who's going to listen to me? Who even fucking cares?

Not even I care. You're a sick fuck. So what? Maybe if you were the first one I'd ever encountered that'd be interesting. Might have even been impressive. But not now. Being sick isn't unique or special. Hell, it'd be way more impressive, much, much more frightening if you were fucking well adjusted or some shit like that.

That's something I wouldn't really know how to deal with. I mean, what the fuck does anybody say to a fucking normal person? Seriously.

Normal people, with their normal houses and their normal cars and their normal jobs and their normal holidays and their normal friends and their normal children and they might as fucking well be characters in a movie, or mindless drones in a video game.

One time, when I was still a little kid, my uncle wrote me a book for my birthday. I'd only just learnt to read and I thought it was the most amazing thing ever. My uncle wrote a book just for me! My own book! Nobody else had one like it! Incredible.

It was called "They're going to try to make you normal" and it was all about how I shouldn't conform, how I should be different and myself, no matter what society tried to make me. I was too young to really understand it, but I guess I read it again when I was older because I remember what it was about. I wonder what he'd think of me now?

I wonder if he'd think all of this was his fault? Do you think all of this is his fault? I mean, I know your sort usually looks for fucked up parental issues. If you can inject a touch of incest you do, after all your entire profession is for perverts, but still. Do you think this is his fault?

For mine, I don't. I mean, if we could actually all point back to one moment in time, one incident and say "that's the thing that made me who I am", well that'd make us all much simpler creatures than we really are, wouldn't it?

But it's nice to have a scapegoat waiting in the wings, just in case it becomes necessary to make use of one. Not that a scapegoat's going to work in my case. There's no grassy knoll, there's no hint of a second shooter. I have literally no alibi. It turns out that sleeping on your own is really fucking impractical if you want to be able to assure the cops you didn't do something. I wish I'd thought of that excuse when mum was still trying to stop me bringing girlfriends home.

Anyway, I think that's probably the daily duty done and in any case I'm sick of you and this and me and fucking words for now. Time for my kale salad. With goat's cheese of course.
