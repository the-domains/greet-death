The naming of things is to craft their life, their bent and their course. In the act of naming, we imbue the subject with the properties of the name ascribed. This site is named for one of my favourite pieces of music by the band Explosions in the Sky.[][0]

As I began to think about the name, and how I'd begin in this new place I was also reminded of one of my favourite quotes, which I'd always thought came from Tecumseh, and which I've subsequently learned is disputed in origin. Regardless, I find beauty in these words and seek to live up to more than a little of it:

* _So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart. 
Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their view, and 
demand that they respect yours. Love your life, perfect your life, 
beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long and 
its purpose in the service of your people. Prepare a noble death song 
for the day when you go over the great divide. Always give a word or a 
sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger, when 
in a lonely place. Show respect to all people and grovel to none. 
When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy 
of living. If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only 
in yourself. Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to
fools and robs the spirit of its vision. When it comes your time to 
die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, 
so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time 
to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song 
and die like a hero going home._

I don't know what this space will become. I don't know how much thought I'll really give it. But the world is full of things that I don't know and this is a corner in which I will instead slowly carve out pieces of knowledge and perhaps find the rare vein of wisdom.

Beginnings, like namings, have much to do with the arc of a thing, but they are not the thing itself.
