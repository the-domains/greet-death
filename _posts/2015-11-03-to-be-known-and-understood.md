Sometimes working on a technical problem can provide me with a certain amount of comfort and peace. Something that really requires my focus and attention. I can slip on headphones and descend into the task at hand, losing myself and the endless run-on fucking sentences as the job takes over.

But those times are rare exceptions. For the most part I'm distracted and sabotaged by my fickle and wandering mind. And in the few gaps between these two extremes I'm interrupted by fucking idiots full of their own self-importance. Braying fools who think their every idea is a guaranteed jackpot, 'if only someone else would carry it forward' \[meaningful look\].

I'd have more time and maybe even a shred of respect for these fucking fools if they ever, even once, had the courage of their supposed convictions and were willing to put their own money or effort behind the shit they dream of. The chattering of empty pots fills my workspace and I am told to call these lesser beings 'colleagues'. There's nothing collegial about our relationship.

That implies a semblance of equality and they are not my equals. They barely deserve my contempt and their value to the company can only be meaningfully measured in terms of how much they obstruct and hold me back.

It's a long list of supposed executives who need to be executed. Metaphorically of course, or perhaps not. In either case the basic outcome would be the same. A brief period of morning presumably, by someone, somewhere and then the freedom of paying for the longevity and laziness of pricks literally trying to run out the clock to their retirement.

To all the gods that so clearly don't exist in any of the universes, may these worthless mounds of flesh retire early. This is my prayer.

Fuck you all for not existing to answer my most heartfelt and sincere prayers.

So the bullshit abides. It abides and perversely, it grows even though we are long past the time when our organisation has had a bull in it. So where does all the shit come from? Are these hollow suits smuggling it in inside their pockets? Do they fill their briefcases with it and pile it up when they think nobody is looking? Do they eat their fill of fresh shit in the mornings and then when they get to the office, do they open their gaping maws wide and drool shit everywhere?

All I know is that that mountains are getting harder to see over and the smell is impossible to ignore. The weight of it is bringing us down too. Quite literally down. Two months ago our head office was on the 42nd floor and now we're on the 17th. At this rate we'll be in the sub-basement below the parking garage before Christmas.

One Christmas my parents got me a brick. Well, technically they got my brother a brick, but the story works better if I tell it as if it happened to me so just go with it.

So anyway, they got me a brick. It was under the tree and had my name on it and when I picked it up the box was SO heavy and so I knew it had to be good. I was so excited. I just knew it was going to be a special present. I opened it really carefully. I read the card first and then I slid my finger under the tape and pulled gently. I made sure I didn't rip anything. I undid the folds and tried to get a peek at what was inside. As I got the paper open and realised it was a box, I just knew that what was inside was going to be amazing. Maybe a video game or a phone, or maybe some incredible new gadget I hadn't even heard of yet.

Then I opened the lid and just sitting there in a pile of scrunched up newspaper so it wouldn't rattle was a fucking brick.

I didn't understand. It made no sense. Was I being fucking PUNISHED? I tried to think of what I could have done? Was this some sort of joke? I looked at my brother and he was happily opening presents. Real presents. He had a water pistol and a book and some clothes. He was fucking happy. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?!

So I quietly got up and walked over to my mum with the box and I put it down next to her and said thank you for the present and gave her a hug. She gave me a big smile and hugged me close and said "Do you like it?"

Do I like it? DO I FUCKING LIKE IT? IT'S A MOTHERFUCKING BRICK! I mean, what do you say to that? Obviously I was being punished. I had no idea what for and I didn't understand what I was supposed to say or do. I was 8, nobody had taught me the rules for proper etiquette when your parents fuck you over on Christmas morning. I just wanted to run to my room, slam the door shut and come out at least a month later. Hopefully having starved to death in the meantime.

So I nodded.

Don't you fucking judge me! I defy you to honestly tell me you'd have done any better at the ripe old age of eight when you've been fucking robbed on the biggest toy day of the year. Yeah, fuck you.

That was when mum looked down, I guess expecting to see me with my new toy in my hands.

'Oh my god baby! I'm so sorry!' She jumped up and ran down the hall. That pissed me off because now I couldn't storm off to my room without looking like I was following her.

I was still trying to work out how to get out the front door and join a travelling ninja clan, vowing my vengeance one day and dispatching victims without remorse in the meantime, when she came back down the hall with her hands behind her back.

'I meant to swap it last night after you went to bed but I forgot. I couldn't leave it under the tree because you'd have worked out what it was straight away.'

Then she pulled a skateboard out from behind herself and I fucking loved bombing the hill our house was on every day on that dodgy thing.

But you know what the craziest thing is? I can barely picture that skateboard now. I mean, in my memory it's got a skateboard shape, and it's white and the wheels were red and I can't remember what stickers or decals were on it. It was just a skateboard. 

But I fucking remember that brick.

I have no idea to revisit my childhood, not even a little bit, but I kind of like that story. That memory. It makes for a good story.

Even if it's not mine.

(Did you forget that it's not my story? Don't lie. You did, didn't you? Don't worry, that's ok. It happens.)

See, that's the thing about me. In the grand scheme of things, I could give a fuck about filling my days and nights, my every waking moment and cursed dream worrying about indolent fucks at work. I could care less about the mountains of bullshit so thick and cloying that they choke me. I don't waste my time or energy on them. Instead I'll inject my every hope and desire into wishing that just for a moment I can tell you a story that's stolen, tell you a total lie and have you forget that I told you upfront I was lying to you.

After all, it's the only way to keep the lie honest, isn't it? And what's life without the certainty of an honest lie? People place too much trust in the truth. Truth is too subjective and memory is too unreliable to be an arbiter of truth. Let the lie live and let it breathe and when it's revealed and understood, it will point irrevocably to the truth. Lies show you what people want to hide, and there's nothing more true than that which people don't want you to see.

When they tell you to look at what's in their left hand, you have maybe a fraction of a second to glimpse what they're palming in their right. And in that moment they are naked, exposed and pure. Their simplest lie will tell you the deepest truth they hold, and then you will know all you need to know about a person.

So tell me _your _truth dear reader. Tell me your lyingest truth and I will know you. Or tell me your truthiest lie and I will know you still. And if you keep reading, and if you pay attention the true lies and the lying truths, then you might just have a chance at knowing me too.

You'll almost certainly regret it.
